# SQL Project

## Overview
Welcome to the SQL project repository! This project is a part of our degree program and serves as our first exercise in working with SQL databases. In this project, we've designed and implemented a database schema to manage various aspects of a business, including customer information, employee records, sales orders, financial data, and more.

## Project Structure
This repository contains SQL scripts to create and define the following tables:
1. `contact`: Stores contact information for individuals.
2. `customer`: Manages customer data, including names, addresses, and contact details.
3. `department`: Keeps track of different departments within the organization.
4. `employee`: Stores employee records, including personal information, salary details, and employment history.
5. `fin_code`: Represents financial codes used in the financial data.
6. `fin_data`: Stores financial data related to the organization, categorized by year and quarter.
7. `product`: Manages product information such as name, description, quantity, and price.
8. `sales_order`: Tracks sales orders placed by customers, including order dates, regions, and sales representatives.
9. `sales_order_items`: Contains details of individual items included in sales orders.

## Getting Started
To set up the database schema on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Use an SQL database management tool (such as MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, or SQLite) to execute the SQL scripts provided in the repository.
3. Execute each SQL script in the order specified to create the necessary tables and define their structure.

## Usage
Once the database schema is set up, you can start using it to store and manage data related to your business. Here are some common tasks you can perform:
- Inserting new records: Add new customers, employees, products, or sales orders to the database.
- Querying data: Retrieve information from the database using SQL queries to analyze sales trends, track employee performance, or generate financial reports.
- Updating records: Modify existing data to reflect changes in customer details, product inventory, or employee status.
- Deleting records: Remove outdated or irrelevant data from the database to maintain data integrity.

## Contributing
This project is part of our degree program and is not open to external contributions at this time. However, feel free to fork the repository and use it for your own learning or experimentation purposes.
